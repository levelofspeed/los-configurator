# streamlit_app.py
# Entry point for Streamlit Community Cloud
# It simply imports and runs the main Streamlit script

# If your main script defines a `main()` function, uncomment and adjust:
# from los_configurator_form_step import main
# if __name__ == "__main__":
#     main()

# Otherwise, import everything from the script so that its top-level Streamlit code runs:
from los_configurator_form_step import *
